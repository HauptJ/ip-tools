# ip-tools
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/ip-tools

A simple PHP website that provides basic TCP/IP diagnostic utilities such as ping, traceroute, TCP port scan, and browser IP and user agent information.

I created this project during the summer of 2014 to familiarize myself with web programing using HTML, PHP and CSS. I originally hosted this on a Ubuntu DigitalOcean VPS running NGINX.
**Note:** DigitalOcean did not support IPv6 at the time this web application was being developed. 

**Note:** The image files used in this project have been lost, however I have started replacing them.
