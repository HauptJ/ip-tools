            <p>Every time you browse a webpage your browser, (Internet Explorer, Safari, etc. ), sends out your user agent, which is a line of information to the server hosting the website that tells it what browser and operating system you are using. This is used to help the web server generate a page that will work best in your browser. For example, if you are using an older browser like Internet Explorer 6, the web server might return a much simpler and stripped down version of the webpage than it would if you were using Internet Explorer 11.Â </p>
            <p>Above is your user agent.</p>
